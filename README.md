# A scraper for e-readers

Project Scriptorium is a readers community that share a lot of free ebooks on EpubLibre website.

The python script search for updates of the ebooks website. And if there's any update, it added to a database and published in Twitter.

The goal is simply to have an impact on the Project Scriptorium and their web EpubLibre via Twitter diffusion.

### Prerequisites

It works on Python 3.X and uses the following libraries:

* urllib.request.
* BeautifulSoup.
* csv.
* tweepy.

### Setup

Since I don't have any service of cloud hosting, in order to automatically and regularly execute it, I use Workflows for iOS working with Pythonista 3. So the script launches in the background with no user intervention.
